- 1st console.log prints undefined because we did not return items in the object
- we have defined items as a variable on the top and with the use of closures we are using it's current value.
- Closure is the ability of the function to remember it's lexical scope after being returned
- we are using the get method defined to access the variable items in lexical scope which will return the actaul result i.e [ 10, 25, 23 ]
- it can also be said we are creating private variable using closures
